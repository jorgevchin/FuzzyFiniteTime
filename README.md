# A fuzzy finite-time controller
WinMechLab code used for the physical implementation of a finite-time fuzzy controller.

The code was used to generate the physical implementation of the control law described in the article "Continuous finite-time fuzzy control of mechanical systems via non-Lipschitz membership functions" which is currently under review.
